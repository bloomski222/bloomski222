*(.github/workflows./Use a secure connection to look up a site’s IP address
When you visit a site, Chrome looks up the site’s host server’s IP address. To protect your privacy and security, if Secure DNS lookup is turned on, Chrome encrypts your information during the lookup process.

By default, Secure DNS in Chrome is turned on in automatic mode. If Chrome has issues looking up a site in this mode, it'll look up the site in the unencrypted mode.

You can select a custom provider. When you select a custom provider, Chrome won't default to unencrypted mode. If you have issues, like error messages, you can check your provider setting or turn Secure DNS off. The error messages may say that the server’s IP address couldn't be found.

Important: If your device is managed or parental controls are turned on, you can’t use Chrome’s secure DNS feature.

Even when connected to a site securely, always be careful when you share sensitive or personal information. Check the site name in the address bar to make sure you're on the site you want to visit.]
         [Manage warnings about unsafe sites
You may get a warning if the site you try to visit is unsafe. These sites are often called phishing or malware sites.

Get warnings about unsafe sites
Phishing and malware detection is turned on by default in Chrome. When you encounter phishing, malware, unwanted software, or social engineering sites, you may get a red warning that says "Dangerous site." If you see this warning, we recommend that you don't visit the site.

To protect you from unsafe websites, Google Safe Browsing maintains a list of websites that might put you at risk for malware, abusive extensions, phishing, malicious and intrusive ads, and social engineering attacks.

To detect and warn you about known and new unsafe sites in real time, you can also turn on Enhanced Safe Browsing. Learn about Safe Browsing protection level in Chrome.

Tip: Download with caution. Some sites may tell you that you have a virus to get you to download harmful software. Be careful not to download any harmful software.

        *When you use Google Safe Browsing in Chrome, you receive warnings that help protect you against malware, abusive sites and extensions, phishing, malicious and intrusive ads, and social engineering attacks.

Safe Browsing crawls and analyzes the web to discover potentially harmful sites and add them to its lists. Each time you visit a website or attempt a download, Chrome checks with Safe Browsing based on the protection level you've selected.

You can choose:

Enhanced protection: Google’s most secure browsing experience, Enhanced protection offers security from known and potential new dangers.
Standard protection: By default, Standard protection offers security from known dangers.
No protection (not recommended): You can also turn off Safe Browsing, but you won't be protected against potentially dangerous websites, downloads, and extensions. Your Safe Browsing setting in other Google products won’t be affected.
You can choose to visit an unsafe site or download a file after you receive a warning from Chrome.
